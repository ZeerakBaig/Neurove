Neurove is an extensive biometrics project aimed to detect facial paralysis in facial images. The project demonstrates a comparison between traditional machine learning techniques versus Deep learning techniques.
 - Tradition Techniques: Uses various facial distance measures as features serving facial paralysis dectection.
 - Deep Learning techniques: Using facial mesh as feature along with MobilenetV2 convolutional neural network architecture for classification purposes.
